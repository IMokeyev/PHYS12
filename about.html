            Hey all! I'm Ivan, a senior from Vermont, and who's originally Russian-Ukranian and born in Russia! I love climbing, skiing, the outdoors, music (playing, listening, and writing), good times, and especially engineering. I'm making this documention to try and flesh out my full creative potential in the engineering field, as here I get to learn about and access manufacturing technologies and other useful tools. Looking forward to making as much as I can, with as much effort and fun as I can!
