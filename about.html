  <p class = "abouttext"> Hey all! I'm Ivan, I'm Russian-Ukranian and originally born in Moscow. I currently live in Vermont, and have a keen interest and everything STEM (especially engineering), music, and rock climbing. I'm a rising senior in higihschool and I'm likely going to be an engineering major, so I'm very excited to have the oppurtunity to participate in Intro to Digital Fabrication this summer! </p>
