	<p class="projecttextright" style=" position:relative; top:-550px; left: 30px; ">A safe, accurate, stablized, remote control robotic arm that allows the user to do precise work from afar, whether it be from a few meters away due to dangerous materials, or from miles away to perform the work remotely. 
	<br><br>
	This arm would use camera hand tracking technology from the MediaPipe library in order to capture the movements and position of the user's hand, then send it over to a microcontroller such as an ESP32, and translate it into motion of the arm, wrist, and phalanges through space.
	<br><br>
	Now in order to move each of the fingers precisely, I would use a system of aritificial tendons, which could be tightened and loosesen through motor control, much like the diagram on the left.

	<p class="projecttextleft" style="position: relative; top: -800px;">
	The parts would likely be 3D printed for cheap and accurate manufacturing of the parts, but protypes should be constructed and tested using a faster manufacturing technique.
