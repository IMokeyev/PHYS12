  <p class="projecttextcenter" style="position: relative; top: -350px;"> This 2d fabrication project was an exercise in modeling and thinking using a 2 dimensional material in 3 dimensions. The material of choice was cardboard, as it was cheap and easy to cut quickly with the laser cutter. For my design, I chose to create a model hand with notches for adjustable posing that would press-fit together, no adhesives or other support of any kind. My first trials were a couple of parts I used to: A) Test notch length, and B) test the kerf of the laser cutter. These parts would also serve as the base design for the components of the fingers.

  This first attempt at producing parts proved that the notches were not deep enough for a proper/stable fit. In order to remedy this, I made the notches deeper. I also scaled up the size of the parts in general (except for the width of the notches, that needs to be constant). with these properties, I also made a better and more rigid design for the finger construction. Lastly, i also added multiple lengths of the different parts in order to better differentiate between the different fingers of the hand.

  Now with the finger figured out, the last step was to design a palm assembly that could also be adjusted. I made sure to use similar parts in the design as I did in the finger in order to ease the design process. The final palm assembly parts had cut out notches which would function as holes for inserts that would connect to the fingers and thumb, along with a spot for a connector between the two halves of the palm. Here are all the parts for assembly of the hand:
