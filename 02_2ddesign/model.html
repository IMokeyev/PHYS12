<p class="projecttextleft" style="position: relative; top: -300px;"> For the first model, I decided to stick to something simple. Just the case of my earbuds in the closed position, since it's a simple shape for the most part with not too many details. Now in order to begin the model, I measured the basic dimensions of the base of the case, then made a sketch and extruded that sketch to the correct height.</p>

<p class="projecttextleft" style="position: relative; top: -510px;"> The next two steps were relatively simple; adding filles to round off the corners of the extruded prism, and then to add a new sketch on one of the faces for details such as the LED hole, the charging port, and the button next to it. After that, it was as simple as extruding those profiles in order to add the details.</p>

	Finally, the last detail was the notch that goes aroudn the entire case, seperating the case into the top and bottom parts. This was done using a sketch on an offset plane, along with the offset, extrude, and fillet tools. Here's the final product compared the case in real life!
