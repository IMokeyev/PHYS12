            Photoresistor calibration:
          </h1>
          <p>
            For my choice of standard, prapackaged sensor, I chose photoresistor. In order to calibrate the photoresistor, I used my phone's flashlight, which has 6 different level settings for brightness. By holding my phone at the same distance everytime, i can calibrate the sensor to read what level of brightness my phone is on. Here's the circuit and the code I used for calibration, with the circuit consisting of an ESP32 Devkit V1 board, a 10K ohm resistor, and a photoresistor.

        <p>Using this code, I found the readings for every value of brightness on my phone's flashlight. I then plotted them in Desmos, resulting in a graph that looked like this:</p>

        <h2 class="tshadow">Fig. 6.3: Plot of averaged analogRead() values</h2>
        <p>
          By using this graph and the derived line of best fit, I created an inverse equation to map the photoresistor values to the light levels on my phone. Here is the added code used to do that:

          <h1 class="tcenter tshadow">Water Level Sensor</h1>
          <p>Using a plastic syringe and some copper tape, I created a device to measure the amount of water in the syringe in mL. This circuit consisted of just an Arduino board with copper tape attached through alligator clips to two GPIO pins for Tx-Rx sensing.</p>

          <h2 class="tshadow">Fig. 6.5: Water level sensor</h2>
          <p>I then used some code to use Tx-rx sensing. This program effectively sends pulses of voltage to the Tx pin, connected to some form of electrode (in this case the copper tape), and then measure the signal recieved on the Rx pin, connected to a recieving electrode (also copper tape). The water inside the syringe effects these values based on how much is in the syringe.</p>

    Serial.begin(9600);

  for (int i = 0; i < N_samples; i++){

  return sum;

        <p>
          I then used the Serial Plotter to observe the values returned by this program depending on different amoutns of water in the syringe. I then plotted these values in Desmos as before, formed a curve of best fit, and then used the inverse of that curve to find a function that accurately maps out the sensing values to water levels. In this case, it was a linear function.
